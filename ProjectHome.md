## About phpcheckout ##
This php-based Equipment Checkout is designed to meet the needs of a university IT labs or small lending libraries. It has the ability to group students and equipment by class and limit availability by those groupings. It can also group major pieces of equipment with accessories for kits so that smaller items (batteries, lens caps, etc.) are tracked as well.

The bulk of the code is based on phpLabMan developed in part by Kevin Reynen. He is now developing a similar project as part of the drupal cms.
